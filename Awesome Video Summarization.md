# Awesome Video Summarization

## 1. Task Definition

Video summarization aims to generate a short synopsis that summarize the video content by selecting its most informative and important parts.

According different definition of "part", e.g., frame or segment, video summarization have two types of sub-tasks.

- Video storyboard.
- Video skim.
