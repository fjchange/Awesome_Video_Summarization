# Awesome Video Summarization

## 1. Task Definition

Video summarization aims to generate a short synopsis that summarize the video content by selecting its most informative and important parts.

According different definition of "part", e.g., frame or segment, video summarization have two types of sub-tasks.

- Video storyboard.
- Video skim.

### Three setting

In Video Summarization with Long Short-term Memory (ECCV 2016), it proposed three types of setting for video summarization.

> - **Canonical**  This is the standard supervised learning setting where the <u>training, validation, and testing sets are from the same dataset, though they are disjoint</u>
>
> - **Augmented** In this setting, for a given dataset, we randomly leave 20% of it for testing, and <u>augment the remaining 80% with the other three datasets to form an augmented training and validation dataset</u>. Our hypothesis is that, despite being heterogeneous in styles and contents, the augmented dataset can be beneficial in improving the performance of our models because of the increased amount of annotations.
> - **Transfer** In this setting, for a given dataset, we <u>use the other three datasets for training and validation and test the learned models on the dataset</u>. We are interested in investigating if existing datasets can effectively transfer summarization models to new unannotated datasets. If the transfer can be successful, <u>then it would be possible to summarize a large number of videos in the wild where there is virtually no closely corresponding annotation.</u>
